    <p><cite>Avatar</cite> is a 2009 epic science fiction film written and directed by James Cameron. It features an
        ensemble cast including Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez, and Sigourney Weaver.[5]
        Distributed by 20th Century Fox,[a] it is the first installment in the Avatar film series. The film is set in
        the mid-22nd century, when humans are colonizing Pandora, a lush habitable moon of a gas giant in the Alpha
        Centauri star system, in order to mine the valuable unobtanium,[b] a room-temperature superconductor mineral.
        The expansion of the mining colony threatens the continued existence of a local tribe of Na'vi, a humanoid
        species indigenous to Pandora. The title of the film refers to a genetically engineered Na'vi body operated from
        the brain of a remotely located human that is used to interact with the natives of Pandora called an
        "Avatar".[9]</p>
    <p>Development of <def>Avatar</def> began in 1994, when Cameron wrote an 80-page treatment for the film.[10][11]
        Filming was supposed to take place after the completion of Cameron's 1997 film Titanic, for a planned release in
        1999;[12] however, according to Cameron, </p>
